# Second-hand-Auto-Inventory-Insights

# Introduction

**Secondhand Car Inventory Management System** is designed to manage and analyze secondhand car dealership data. The project focuses on extracting key insights from the database using SQL queries to track the availability of cars, categorize them by year and fuel type, and generate reports to support business decisions.

### Key Objectives:
- **Total Car Count:** Utilized SQL queries to count the total number of cars in the database, providing a quick overview of available inventory.
- **Cars by Year:** Answered queries such as how many cars will be available in a specific year (2020, 2021, 2022, 2023) and aggregated the data to show total cars by year.
- **Fuel Type Analysis:** Extracted data based on fuel types like petrol, diesel, and CNG to identify the distribution of cars by fuel type across different years.
- **Car Availability Above 100 Units:** Implemented queries to identify which years had more than 100 cars available for sale.
- **Detailed Yearly Report:** Created a comprehensive list of car details for each year, specifically for the years 2015 to 2023, to provide the manager with a detailed overview of inventory and trends.

### Approach:
- **SQL Queries:** Utilized advanced SQL functions like **COUNT()**, **GROUP BY**, **WHERE**, and **HAVING** to answer critical business questions, helping the dealership understand car availability trends and fuel preferences over the years.
- **Data Filtering and Aggregation:** Filtered data by specific years and fuel types, allowing the manager and employees to make informed decisions about car sales and inventory.
  
This project demonstrates the power of SQL in managing and analyzing inventory data, offering practical solutions for the operations of a secondhand car dealership and providing valuable insights into market trends.
